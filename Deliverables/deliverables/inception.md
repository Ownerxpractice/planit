Project Inception -- Group 1

 

**Introduction:** 

 

Many small businesses and independent professionals spend too much time
coordinating appointments by phone, email, or paper calendars, which
often leads to double-bookings, missed opportunities, and frustrated
clients. Without a clear system for tracking availability, owners of
shops like barbers, photographers, or tutors struggle to keep their
schedules organized and risk losing revenue. This inefficiency not only
wastes staff time but also damages customer trust when appointments
collide or communication breaks down. To solve this challenge, we
propose a web-based booking calendar application that lets business
owners define and share their open time slots online. Clients receive a
simple link where they can view available times and reserve a slot
without creating an account. By centralizing appointments in one
accessible calendar, our solution reduces administrative overhead and
ensures a reliable, professional experience for both businesses and
their customers. 

 

**Initial Value Proposition:** 

 

Value Proposition: 

Service providers can eliminate booking errors and reclaim hours of
administrative time by empowering clients to self-schedule appointments
on a single centralized calendar. 

 

Customer Segment: 

Small, appointment-driven businesses, such as barbershops, photography
studios, and private tutoring services, that currently rely on phone,
email, or paper calendars to manage bookings. 

 

**Interviews:** 

 

1.  Interview with Ella Davis by Taylor Davis on 6/11/25 -- 

> Ella is a full-time professional photographer who schedules between 4
> -- 10 photoshoots a week. She is a small business owner and was the
> original inspiration for the booking calendar application. She is the
> ideal candidate for the booking calendar application. 
>
>  
>
> Important Q&A: 
>
>  
>
> Q: "What is your typical scheduling process?" 
>
> A: "I use a calendar and communicate with the client, talking back and
> forth until we find a time that works for both of us." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "What do you use to schedule your clients?" 
>
> A: "I use Google Calendar." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "What are the challenges you face when scheduling your clients?" 
>
> A: "Remembering, and making sure that I actually put them in the
> calendar. It is completely my responsibility, and they don't know if I
> put them in the calendar." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "Roughly how much time do you spend on scheduling each week?" 
>
> A: "1.5 hours" 
>
>  
>
> Q: "Can you describe your ideal scheduling experience?" 
>
> A: "I would be on a call with a client and they could just see my
> schedule and all my available times. Then they could pick a time that
> works for them where I don't have to interact with the direct
> scheduling process. I would love a preconfigured schedule with all the
> times that I am available and with a ranking system where maybe I
> could offer a discount for picking times that are extra convenient for
> me." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "How useful would the tool that I have described be for you on a
> scale of 1 to 10?" 
>
> A: "9" 
>
>  
>
> Q: "If this tool were to be priced, how much would you be willing to
> pay for it?" 
>
> A: "\$8 monthly" 

 

> Insights: Ella certainly would be a great candidate for this
> application, and she gave the idea to use a "ranked" block schedule
> where clients could see times that are available with a priority
> level. I also found that the booking calendar is actually a valuable
> product worth making.

2.  Interview with Kayley Willis by Taylor Davis on 6/12/25 -- 

> Kayley is the owner-operator of an official 501(c)(3) (Non-profit
> charity) called 3E Snacks. She typically schedules 1-5 parties a week
> to package food for kids in the public school system who do not have
> reliable meals over the weekends. She is an ideal candidate for the
> booking calendar. 
>
>  
>
> Important Q&A: 
>
>  
>
> Q: "What is your typical scheduling process?" 
>
> A: "It is just people texting and we find a time that they can come.
> Then I put it in my calendar." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "What do you use to schedule your clients?" 
>
> A: "A paper planner and a digital calendar together. Then I set an
> alarm to let me know that someone is coming." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "What are the challenges you face when scheduling your clients?" 
>
> A: "I double-book people and forget people are coming to pack bags.
> It's important that I set an alarm and give myself a reminder that
> people are coming." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "Roughly how much time do you spend on scheduling each week?" 
>
> A: "20 -- 60 minutes" 
>
>  
>
> Q: "Can you describe your ideal scheduling experience?" 
>
> A: "It would be great if I had some online or an app where I had
> someone who wanted to book and they see it, I see it and I can have a
> follow-up. I would love a way to get notifications on any changes to
> the calendar too."  
>
>  
>
> Q: "How useful would the tool that I have described be for you on a
> scale of 1 to 10?" 
>
> A: "10" 
>
>  
>
> Q: "If this tool were to be priced, how much would you be willing to
> pay for it?" 
>
> A: "\$10 monthly" 

 

> Insights: I had a few big insights from this interview. The first
> thing I gathered is that a notification feature for both parties is
> absolutely necessary. Something that can send a text and an email
> notification that maybe the attendee can RSVP would be great as well.
> Kayley really enjoyed our conversation, and she said that if the
> product we discussed could save her time and help her keep track of
> the bookings, it would be very valuable to her. She also mentioned
> that it would be great to have a different type of booking for each
> type of visitor would be very helpful. This supports my idea to have a
> priority or customizable key feature for the calendar maker. This
> interview supported my idea that this is a very viable product if made
> correctly. One last feature that we discussed and she asked for was to
> have the link be generated as a QR code.

3.  Interview with Santiago Sandoval by Noelia Canela on 6/14/25 --  

> Santiago visits and schedules appointments with families to discuss
> what their health insurance can provide for them. Scheduling is
> important to him because he needs to meet with families daily to
> assure that his customers are obtaining the care they need. Meetings
> are often scheduled days in advance to assure consistency.  
>
>   
>
> Important Q&A:  
>
>   
>
> Q: \"Can you describe a time when scheduling didn't go as planned?
> What happened and how did you handle it?\" 
>
> A: "I would have to call the family and explain how I forgot to add
> them to the calendar. I would explain that I am available to
> reschedule during certain time blocks. Explain the situation and
> assure consistency."  
>
>   
>
> Q: \"What's the first thing you usually do when someone wants to book
> time with you?\" 
>
> A: "I make sure I know when that meeting will be due for me, then I
> book the meeting about 2 weeks ahead of time in case of an
> emergency."  
>
>   
>
> Q: \"Do you ever wish you had a way to organize different types of
> bookings separately?\" 
>
> A: "Yes! Something where my boss can't see my personal bookings. I
> have two different calendars that I follow. I would love to not have
> my work schedule conflict with my personal schedule."   
>
>   
>
> Q: \"How do you usually follow up with someone after they schedule?\" 
>
> A: "There is an automated robot that contacts them 7 days prior to let
> them know and remind them they have a meeting. If they don't respond
> to the automated robot, then I get an email that says that they want
> to reschedule. Then I call them to ask if they really want to
> reschedule, then go from there.  
>
>   
>
> Q: \"How important is it for you to be notified about changes to your
> schedule in real time?\" 
>
> A: "I would say that is important, most changes that I receive is ones
> stating that I received a new client. I wouldn't want to miss a
> meeting with a client and then have that conflict with my personal
> life as well."  
>
>   
>
> Q: \"If someone wanted to cancel or reschedule, what's the easiest way
> for them to let you know right now?\" 
>
> A: "I would prefer them to just call me. Most of my clients don't pay
> attention to their email invites. If you all had something where my
> client could text me about cancelling and then have that reflected on
> my email, it would be amazing. " 
>
>   
>
> Q: \"What would make a scheduling tool feel 'easy' or stress free for
> you?\" 
>
> A: If it could recognize that there is some sort of scheduling pattern
> for me such as a meeting. If I forget to add one to my calendar, have
> a reminder pop up to make sure that I don't forget future meetings.  

  

> Insights: I found this interview to be insightful. Santiago talked
> about the necessity of a scheduling system that allows professional
> and personal organization for busy people like himself. He currently
> uses two separate calendars and always has difficulty with work vs
> personal life schedule conflicts. I found that Santiago likes real
> time notifications, especially when a new client is scheduled to avoid
> conflict and expressed that he was annoyed that clients would not
> respect email reminders. He talked about how he would want a system
> where clients can cancel or reschedule via text, and those
> cancellations automatically appear on his calendar. This would make it
> easier to connect with clients because everyone is always on their
> phone. He also expressed interest in having a smart scheduling tool
> that would be able to learn about patterns in his meetings and notify
> him when something routine is missing. Overall, Santiago made me think
> about the need for a more responsive and collaborative friendly
> planning system that takes into mind user and client requirements.

4.  Interview with Christian Butler by Kieran McKinney on 6/14/25 -  

> Christian is a Software Engineer at BD. He schedules meetings a few
> times per week with clients.  
>
>   
>
> Q&A: 
>
>   
>
> Q: \"How often do you need to schedule meetings with clients?\" 
>
> A: \"Weekly on the low end, mostly 2-3 times per week\" 
>
>   
>
> Q: \"What tools do you currently use to facilitate that?\" 
>
> A: \"Calendly, Teams, and Zoom depending on the client and their
> schedules\" 
>
>   
>
> Q: \"How long do you spend per week on scheduling?\" 
>
> A: \"Probably an hour or two, depending on the circumstance\" 
>
>   
>
> Q: \"Do you have any complaints about your current scheduling
> methods?\" 
>
> A: \"Working with other\'s schedules, teams does this great, but not
> everyone is microsoft driven.\" 
>
>   
>
> Q: \"How often do you miss meetings or find yourself losing track of
> time?\" 
>
> A: \"I have missed one meeting I can think about to date, completely
> slipped my mind for a internship.\" 
>
>   
>
> Q: \"Do you think this product could replace your current scheduling
> methods?\" 
>
> A: \"I think there COULD be a want for this. In my opinion, this is a
> product you are building to get acquired or bring universal features
> to major calendar apps. I would try to find what separates you from
> Teams, as most of these aspects are covered in teams, and it does have
> full calendar integrations already. I would revise the product
> statement, find something that could really stand you apart from the
> rest of the products on market, or focus on a feature that is truly
> innovative.\" 
>
>   
>
> Insights: 
>
> This interview highlights that while the Christian regularly schedules
> meetings and spends a modest amount of time doing so, he already
> relies on established tools like Calendly, Teams, and Zoom, depending
> on the client\'s preferences. A key pain point lies in coordinating
> with others who aren\'t using the same platform, especially when not
> everyone is part of the Microsoft ecosystem. He stressed that the
> current market is saturated and that PlanIt would need to offer a
> clearly different or innovative feature to gain traction. His
> perspective suggests that for PlanIt to stand out, it should either
> introduce a novel scheduling experience, or double down on simplifying
> cross-platform scheduling for users. I believe that is definitely
> something possible to do, as we are trying to create a platform that
> allows for people to easily schedule meetings without creating an
> account.

>
> A: "At least once a week." 
>
>  
>
> Q: \"Do wish you had a way to organize different types of bookings

>
> A: "Yeah I do to make things easier and make it more productive to
> schedule meetings and get them done in a timely manner." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "Do you schedule workouts with clients?" 
>
> A: "Yeah I do they often schedule a day and I see if I am available
> that day." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "Would you be open to using an online system on your personal
> computer to schedule meetings in an organized matter with clients?"  
>
> A: "I would if it was at an affordable price or free to use otherwise,
> I would stick to what I am doing now." 
>
>  
>
> Q: "What would the price range look like for you?" 
>
> A: "Looking from a price range of \$5-\$20." 
>
>  
>
> Insight: Silus is a growing fitness entrepreneur who currently uses
> his phone and texting to schedule and manage weekly client
> concessions. While this method works, he acknowledges a need for
> better organization when managing different types of bookings. He
> expressed interests in using an online scheduling system that falls in
> a modest budget and his openess to improve tools signal a market
> opportunity for this platform and its uses and tailor it to his solo

7.  Interview with Dunia Amiri by ShaNiece Twitty on 6/13/25 --  

> Dunia is a full-time esthetician who owns her own studio. She provides
> personalized skincare and beauty treatments to a growing number of
> clients. Scheduling is important to her because she manages all
> aspects of her business on her own. Her income depends on how well she
> organizes and fills her schedule.  
>
>  
>
> Q: How do you currently handle appointment bookings? 
>
> A: I use Google's Appointment Scheduler. I've set up my availability,
> and clients can book through the link I share. 
>
>  
>
> Q: What do you like about using Google's tool? 
>
> A: It's simple and integrates with my Google Calendar. I don't have to
> manually enter each appointment. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Do you still spend time managing or confirming appointments? 
>
> A: Less than before, but I still get DMs asking for clarification or
> help rescheduling. 
>
>  
>
> Q: What's the most frustrating part of managing appointments? 
>
> A: The lack of customization. I can't assign different time lengths or
> prices to different services easily. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Do you lose business due to missed messages or delays? 
>
> A: Sometimes. Google's tool doesn't notify me in real-time, so I
> occasionally miss urgent changes or messages. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Would it help if clients could reschedule or cancel on their own? 
>
> A: Definitely, but I'd want to control how close to the appointment
> they're allowed to do that. 
>
>  
>
> Q: How important is it for you to control booking windows? 
>
> A: Very. I don't want people booking the night before. I need buffer
> time. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Do you offer services that can only be booked on certain
> days/times? 
>
> A: Yes. For example, I only do specific facials on Mondays and
> Thursdays because they take longer. 
>
>  
>
> Q: How would you prefer to be notified of new appointments? 
>
> A: Text would be ideal. 
>
>  
>
> The interview with Dunia who uses Google's Appointment Scheduler
> highlighted the tool's ease of use and calendar integration but also
> revealed key limitations. Her biggest concern is the lack of control
> over how far in advance clients can book, she prefers more lead time
> to prepare and avoid last-minute bookings. She also noted the
> inability to set different durations or rules for specific services.
> While email notifications are helpful, she would rather get real-time
> updates via text. These insights point to a need for a more
> customizable system that gives service providers tighter control over
> booking timing and client access.

8.  Interview with Ayden Smith by ShaNiece Twitty on 6/14/25 --  

> Ayden Smith is a lash technician working at Cotton Salon and Spa. She
> offers a range of lash services and sees multiple clients throughout
> the week. While she doesn't run her own business, managing her
> schedule is still important to ensure he maximizes her booked time and
> avoids overlap or downtime. 
>
>  
>
> Q: How do you currently handle appointment bookings? 
>
> A: The salon uses Vagaro, so all appointments go through that system.
> I don't personally manage bookings, the front desk or clients book
> directly. 
>
>  
>
> Q: How do most clients book with you? 
>
> A: Clients usually book online through the salon's Vagaro page, or
> they call the front desk. I rarely get involved unless someone reaches
> out to me directly. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Do you like how the salon uses Vagaro? 
>
> A: It's convenient. I can see my schedule, service times, and notes
> all in one place. It makes it easy to stay organized. 
>
>  
>
> Q: What's the most frustrating part of your current system? 
>
> A: Sometimes appointments are added incorrectly or miscommunicated. If
> clients don't fully read the service descriptions, they might show up
> expecting something else. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Do you deal with no-shows or last-minute cancellations? 
>
> A: Yes, occasionally. The system sends reminders, but it still
> happens. I'm not in charge of enforcing policies, though, management
> handles that. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Would you like clients to reschedule on their own without calling? 
>
> A: I think it helps reduce workload for the front desk, so yes. But
> sometimes clients reschedule too close to their appointment and it
> creates gaps in the day. 
>
>  
>
> Q: Do clients ever struggle with using the booking system? 
>
> A: Older clients or first-timers sometimes get confused or book the
> wrong thing. Then I have to adjust or explain when they arrive. 
>
>  
>
> Q: If you could improve one thing about the system, what would it be? 
>
> A: I'd make the interface more client-friendly. A lot of confusion
> comes from people not fully understanding what they're booking or how
> the system works. 
>
> Ayden noted that while Vagaro works well overall, the user interface
> can be confusing for some clients, especially those less tech-savvy.
> She emphasized the importance of a cleaner, more intuitive booking
> experience that makes it easier for clients to select services and
> times without frustration, ultimately helping reduce booking mistakes
> and improving client satisfaction.

9.  Interview with Becca Smith by Brandon Tavares on 6/14/25 --  

> Becca Smith is a project manager for the video team at Northern
> Arizona University. She is currently using Microsoft Teams to schedule
> video shoots with talent and the video team. Keeping track of her
> events on a calendar is crucial for her to stay organized and ensure
> that her projects are finished by their set deadline.  
>
>  
>
> Important Q&A:  
>
> Q: "How does scheduling play a role in your position?"  
>
> A: "It plays a huge role in my position. It is my job to schedule
> meetings with clients, and video shoots with people who are
> participating in our videos and the video team themselves."  
>
>  
>
> Q: "What do you use to schedule your clients?"  
>
> A: "Well I schedule my meetings and shoot on Microsoft Teams."

>  
>
> Q: "What are some issues you face with Teams"  
>
> A: "I don't really have many issues with Teams."  
>
>  
>
> Q: "What are some issues that you face while scheduling with

>
> A: "Sometimes it is difficult to schedule shoots with students because

>  
>
> Q: "How can your experience in regard to scheduling be improved"  
>
> A: "I think it would be useful to be able to sort your upcoming events

>
>   
>
> Q: "What features do believe are crucial for a scheduling
> application"  
>
> A: "Link events with Adobe Workfront, allow app to assign tasks to

> items in calendar, and the ability to share events through email."  
>
>  
>
> Q: "How useful would this product be at your job"  
>
> A: "If it contained all the same functionality that I just mentioned I
> think that it would be very useful to have a free calendar app
> accessible to everyone.  
>
>  
>
> Becca noted that although Microsoft Teams works for her, it lacks some
> features like sporting events by attendees, and a more intuitive
> search menu on the calendar. She values tools that improve
> coordination and visibility. In her situations, it may be difficult to
> switch over since her issues aren\'t great enough to try anything
> else. Her institution also widely uses Teams and may be difficult to
> use another application. Her insights show that this app could be

**Final Value Proposition:** 

Reduces manual scheduling time by up to 90% and prevents double-bookings
for solo and micro-team service providers by giving them a centralized,
shareable booking calendar with automated reminders. 

**Final Customer Segment:** 

Solo and small-team appointment-driven service providers, such as
photographers, estheticians, tutors, and small non-profit coordinators,
who currently spend 30 to 90 minutes weekly managing multiple bookings
via phone, email, or paper, and need a reliable self-service scheduling
link with real-time notifications.
